# Employee Attrition


We handled the imbalanced data by using some techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, Tomek Links, SMOTETomek etc.

Here we used several machine learning classification model to see whether an employee will leave his/her job or not.
In the '.ipynb' file I have evaluated a brief exploratory data analysis on this dataset and then developed various machine learning models. 

##### we have read out some papers to do this project... Papers are given in the 'papers' folder... Further we have to tune our model to get good results on this data
